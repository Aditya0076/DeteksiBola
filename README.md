# DeteksiBola
This repo is the project for your thesis titled "Implementation of a Ball Tracking System In Image Processing Using the Find Contour Method". The project is developed using C++ language and OpenCV library for image processing.

The project aims to develop a ball tracking system using the find contour method for image processing. The system can detect and track balls in real-time. This repo contains all the necessary files and codes to build the ball tracking system, which can be useful for others who are interested in developing similar systems.

In summary, this repo showcases the results of your thesis and provides a valuable contribution to the community interested in developing ball tracking systems using the find contour method in image processing.
